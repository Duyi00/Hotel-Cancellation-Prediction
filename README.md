# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction

## About
This is a mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence).

## Contributors

- @Duyi00 Data Preparation and Cleaning, Data Visualization
- @zihan15 Machine Learning

## Problem Definition

- Predict whether a reservation will be cancelled based on variables [to be determined]
- Which is the best prediction model

## Models Used

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boost Classifier
- Ada Boost Classifier
- Cat Boost Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Logistic regression

## Conclusion

- Random Forest Model is able to predict whether a reservation will be cancelled with 85% accuracy and low false positive rate (8%)
- Random Forest is the most accurate out of all the models used
- Longer lead time and higher adr equates to higher chance of cancellation
- Deposit type affects cancellation rate significantly

## What did we learn from this project?

- Using plotly express to create interactive visualisation
- Plotted geographical data with plotly chloropleth
- Implemented one hot encoding for categorical data and time series
- Implementing 5 new Machine Learning models for prediction 
- Collaborating using GitHub
