# Hotel Cancellation Prediction

In this data science project, we will be utilising data from `hotel_bookings.csv` to answer the following question:

**Problem: Predict whether a Hotel Reservation will be Cancelled based on Variables _[To Be Determined]_**.

## Overview 
Our project is split into **3** sections:

<div style="background-color: #ebf4f7; color: #595959; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;">
<div style="font-size:20px"><b>1. Data Cleaning and Preparation</b></div>
<p>Using <code>NumPy</code> and <code>Pandas</code>, we massaged the raw data into usable forms. Without going into details, we:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Handled Missing Data.</li>
    <li>Removed Extreme Outliers.</li>
    <li>Handled with datetime series to change it into desirable forms.</li>
</ul>
  <p> </p>
<div style="font-size:20px"><b>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b></div>
  <p>Performed EDA on <b>24</b> different variables. We utilised:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Plotly</code>, <code>Seaborn</code>, <code>Matplotlib</code>.</li>
</ul>
  
<div style="font-size:20px"><b>3. Machine Learning</b></div>
  <p>Using <code>sciKit-learn</code>, we implemented models such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Decision Tree Classifier.</li>
    <li>Random Forest Classifier.</li>
    <li>Gradient Boost Classifier.</li>
    <li>Ada Boost Classifier.</li>
    <li>Cat Boost Classifier.</li>
    <li>XGBoost Classifier.</li>
    <li>Logistic regression.</li>
</ul>
    </div>


## Conclusion and Recommendations

In conclusion, we decided to utilise the **Random Forest Classifier** as our final model. This is due to its high accuracy of ~**85%** and relatively low False Positive Rate of ~**8%**.


We have also came up with the following recommendations based on our findings to allow hotels to maximise utilisation of their rooms:

- Lead time : Allow reservations up to 200 days in advance, chance of cancellation increases linearly from there to 400 days. 
- Day/Month : Thursday - Saturday especially during April - October have higher cancellation rates. Allow for more over-booking during this period.
